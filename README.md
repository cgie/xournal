* Xournal

** (Yet another "own version" of Xournal)

I'm using Xournal extensively for writing notes/sketches for my research and
drawing graphics for presentations. In order to get rid of some nuisances I've
forked the repo from dmgerman.

Changes so far:
  - added patch for exporting xoj directly to pdf
    (http://sourceforge.net/p/xournal/patches/48/)
  - added option to set WM_WINDOW_ROLE, very useful for named scratchpads in
    xmonad
